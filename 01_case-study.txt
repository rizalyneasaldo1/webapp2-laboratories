Case Study #1

Our IT company embarked on an ambitious project in January 2024 aimed at delivering a cutting-edge software solution to our users and clients. The project was meticulously planned with a target launch date of June 1. However, as the deadline approaches, it becomes apparent that several tasks are still in progress, and there are unresolved bugs that need attention. The testing process, crucial for ensuring product quality, has not yet begun. As a software engineer involved in the project, what aspects could have been handled better to prevent the delays and issues experienced, such as incomplete tasks, unresolved bugs, and a delayed testing process?

For this activity, evaluate the situation and offer your suggestions on areas where improvements could have been made.

- If I were a software engineer that is involved in this project I will do my very best to prevent any problems like this because it is really time and quality consuming. Based on the given scenario they were lacking in project planning and management. In such projects, there must be detailed planning to be done first, so that the project can be done properly step by step and to ensure the quality of the final product. As the given deadlines, there should be a time estimation for each part of the project, it is also necessary to prioritize those that should be focused on. It is also necessary to have communication to effectively collaborate with project partners and in the same way the progress of shared tasks can also be tracked. While the project is on progress, it should be tested so that a solution or back up plan can be made as early as possible in case of problems at the end. A good and proper project planning and management can result in a high quality and a successful project.
